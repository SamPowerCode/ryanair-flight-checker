**Purpose:**
   - Create a web application using Django to find cheapest available Ryanair flights. The user supplies a date range, and number of days wished to travel between those dates. The app finds the cheapest travel options for the specified number of days within the given date range.


### Step 1: Research Ryanair API
1. **API Endpoints:**
   - Check Ryanairs site, check their public facing APIs
   - Record the URL, HTTP method, response (JSON, XML, etc.) and payload given


### Step 2: Define Requirements
1. **User Inputs:**
   - Start date
   - End date
   - Number of travel days

2. **Outputs:**
   - List of available destinations
   - Cheapest travel options for the specified number of days within the given date range

### Step 3: User Experience and Interface Design
1. **Wireframe:**
   - Sketch a basic layout of your webapp, including input fields, a submit button, and a results display area.

2. **User Flow:**
   - Map out the process from user input to displaying results.
   - Ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.

### Step 4: Design the Application Architecture
1. **Frontend:**
   - Framework: use Django templates
   - UI Elements: Design input fields for start date, end date, and travel days. Include a submit button to initiate the search.

2. **Backend:**
   - **Django Setup:**
     - Create a Django project and app.
     - Set up URL routing to handle requests.
   - **API Integration:**
     - Create a service to interact with the Ryanair API.
     - Implement logic to process user inputs and query the API.
   - **Business Logic:**
     - Calculate all possible travel periods within the given date range.
     - Determine the cheapest travel option for each period.

3. **Database (Optional):**
   - If you want to store user queries or results, set up a database model.
   - Use Django ORM to manage database interactions.

### Step 5: Error Handling and Edge Cases
1. **Input Validation:**
   - Ensure dates are valid and the number of travel days is feasible.
   - Handle invalid inputs gracefully.

2. **API Error Handling:**
   - Manage API errors, such as network issues or invalid responses.
   - Provide user-friendly error messages.

### Step 6: Future Considerations
1. ***Additional Features:**
   - Allow users to filter results by preferences (e.g., direct flights, specific airlines).
   - Implement user authentication for saving preferences or past searches.

### Step 7: Documentation and Testing
1. **Documentation:**
   - Document the API integration process, application setup, and usage instructions.

2. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for backend logic.
   - Test the application with various inputs to ensure reliability.
